### The First Decentralized Nation

**Abstract:** The purpose of this project is to present the foundational steps to establish "Povo de Satoshi" as the first decentralized nation. This document outlines the principles, governance model, and phased approach for creating a sovereign, free, and independent people inspired by the values of Bitcoin. The ultimate goal is to create a decentralized community that operates based on individual freedoms, respect for private property, and human development.

### 1. Introduction

Throughout modern history, centralized social organization has proven inefficient, favoring a political elite at the expense of the general population. This system traps people in a cycle of modern slavery to sustain governmental operations. Technological advancements, particularly the internet and Bitcoin, now enable us to envision and create a new model of social organization—one that is decentralized and driven by the principles of freedom and autonomy.

### 2. Povo de Satoshi

**Povo de Satoshi** embodies the creation of a decentralized nation—a collective of individuals united by the principles and values of Bitcoin. This community aspires to gain international recognition as a sovereign, free, and independent people. Operating on a foundation of minimal consensus, Povo de Satoshi promotes the right to use Bitcoin or any other chosen currency and the freedom to change nationality, underlining the belief that all individuals own themselves and are free to select their state service providers. The only shared commitment is to advocate for, and if necessary, defend these rights for our members, even against other members if unavoidable.

#### 2.1. Historical Context and Technological Advancements

The invention of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has broken a trend as old as humanity. Traditionally, large territorial powers enjoyed asymmetric advantages due to their size and resources. However, the advent of these technologies has inverted this dynamic, creating asymmetric disadvantages for such powers. Smaller, more agile entities can now pose significant deterrent threats, reducing the effectiveness of traditional large-scale military dominance. This shift supports the viability of decentralized, non-territorial entities like Povo de Satoshi, which can leverage technology to ensure their security and sovereignty without relying on conventional military might.

#### 2.2. Steps to Establish Povo de Satoshi

1. **Formation and Union:** 
   - Gather 210,000 individuals committed to the principles of Povo de Satoshi.
   - Each member will sign a statute based on the values of freedom and autonomy.

2. **International Recognition:** 
   - Seek recognition through global judicial systems to establish Povo de Satoshi as a sovereign entity.
   - Engage in peaceful and democratic negotiations with global heads of state to promote good neighborliness and explore land acquisition opportunities.

#### 2.3. Governance and Principles

Povo de Satoshi will be governed by its members through a system of direct democracy, utilizing tokens to represent ownership and participation. This system rejects traditional representative democracy in favor of a model where each individual has a direct voice proportional to their investment in the community. The tokens serve as a testament to members’ commitment, with the funds supporting Povo de Satoshi’s initiatives. However, the primary purpose of the tokens is to demonstrate genuine commitment, proven through hard money, ensuring authenticity and dedication. Additionally, the token system grants members the flexibility to either cast their votes directly or delegate their voting power to a representative of their own choosing.

These tokens should not be confused with NFTs or cryptocurrencies. While they use the same secure and decentralized technology of Bitcoin, they represent a different layer of abstraction. Best seen as a layer 3 technology, these tokens digitalize personal commitment for individuals who do not personally know each other, providing a tangible link to the real world.

The price of 210,000 satoshis per token was carefully chosen to align with the total supply of Bitcoin. In a scenario where the global population reaches an estimated ceiling of 10 billion people, and all join Povo de Satoshi, this price point matches the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist. This design ensures that Povo de Satoshi can accommodate all adults as members while also making the purchasing power of the token price continue to rise with Bitcoin’s adoption.

This structure ensures that the commitment required to join remains proportional to the risk involved. As the entity grows and joining becomes safer, the commitment represented by the token remains significant. Furthermore, it ensures that Povo de Satoshi never becomes a monopoly, fostering competition and the continuous improvement of state services over time.

#### 2.4. Minimum Consensus

Povo de Satoshi members have a minimum consensus on two fundamental principles:
1. **Monetary Freedom:** They will lobby and fight for their members' right to use Bitcoin or any other money of their choice.
2. **Freedom from Coercion:** They will lobby and fight against any state service provider that refuses to allow individuals to opt-out, even if it is a Terra de Satoshi-style project initiated by members of Povo de Satoshi.

These principles encapsulate the common consensus that no state can own humans; instead, all humans own themselves and are free to choose their state service providers. This foundational belief underpins the governance and societal structure of Povo de Satoshi.

### 3. The 7 Pillars of Povo de Satoshi

1. **Absolute Private Property:** True ownership without government interference.
2. **Self-Represented Democracy:** Direct democracy where each member has a voice.
3. **Tax Abolition:** No taxes of any kind, promoting economic freedom.
4. **Free Market:** Encouragement of free trade and economic interactions.
5. **Individual Freedom:** Respect for personal liberties and non-interference in personal choices.
6. **Non-Aggression Ethics:** Coexistence based on mutual respect and voluntary cooperation.
7. **Private Laws and Justice:** Laws proposed and voted on by members, ensuring a society governed by collective values.

### 4. Bitcoin Tokenizer

The Tokenizer will develop and market tokens necessary for the establishment and functioning of Povo de Satoshi. These tokens will facilitate ownership, participation, and the funding of the project.

### 5. Team and Implementation

The project will be carried out by a dedicated team committed to the principles of decentralization and transparency. Funds raised from token sales will be used for land acquisition, infrastructure development, and other necessary expenses.

### 6. Final Considerations

We invite all who share our vision to join us in building the first decentralized nation. This document represents the initial blueprint, and it will be updated as the project evolves. Together, we can make this dream a reality and redefine social organization for the future.
