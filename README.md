# Povo de Satoshi Whitepaper

## Povo de Satoshi:

### The First Decentralized Nation

**Abstract:** The purpose of this project is to present the foundational steps to establish "Povo de Satoshi" as the first decentralized nation. This document outlines the principles, governance model, and phased approach for creating a sovereign, free, and independent people inspired by the values of Bitcoin. The ultimate goal is to create a decentralized community that operates based on individual freedoms, respect for private property, and human development.

### 1. Introduction

Throughout modern history, centralized social organization has proven inefficient, favoring a political elite at the expense of the general population. This system traps people in a cycle of modern slavery to sustain governmental operations. Technological advancements, particularly the internet and Bitcoin, now enable us to envision and create a new model of social organization—one that is decentralized and driven by the principles of freedom and autonomy.

### 2. Povo de Satoshi

**Povo de Satoshi** represents the formation of a decentralized nation—a union of individuals who share the principles and values of Bitcoin. This group will work towards gaining international recognition as a sovereign, free, and independent people. This decentralized community will operate on the basis of libertarianism, promoting individual freedoms, respect for private property, and human development.

#### 2.1. Historical Context and Technological Advancements

The invention of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has broken a trend as old as humanity. Traditionally, large territorial powers enjoyed asymmetric advantages due to their size and resources. However, the advent of these technologies has inverted this dynamic, creating asymmetric disadvantages for such powers. Smaller, more agile entities can now pose significant deterrent threats, reducing the effectiveness of traditional large-scale military dominance. This shift supports the viability of decentralized, non-territorial entities like Povo de Satoshi, which can leverage technology to ensure their security and sovereignty without relying on conventional military might.

#### 2.2. Steps to Establish Povo de Satoshi

1. **Formation and Union:** 
   - Gather 210,000 individuals committed to the principles of Povo de Satoshi.
   - Each member will sign a statute based on the values of freedom and autonomy.

2. **International Recognition:** 
   - Seek recognition through global judicial systems to establish Povo de Satoshi as a sovereign entity.
   - Engage in peaceful and democratic negotiations with global heads of state to promote good neighborliness and explore land acquisition opportunities.

#### 2.3. Governance and Principles

Povo de Satoshi will be governed by its members through a system of direct democracy, utilizing tokens to represent ownership and participation. This system rejects traditional representative democracy in favor of a model where each individual has a direct voice proportional to their investment in the community.

#### 2.4. Minimum Consensus

Povo de Satoshi members have a minimum consensus on two fundamental principles:
1. **Monetary Freedom:** They will lobby and fight for their members' right to use Bitcoin or any other money of their choice.
2. **Freedom from Coercion:** They will lobby and fight against any state service provider that refuses to allow individuals to opt-out, even if it is a Terra de Satoshi-style project initiated by members of Povo de Satoshi.

These principles encapsulate the common consensus that no state can own humans; instead, all humans own themselves and are free to choose their state service providers. This foundational belief underpins the governance and societal structure of Povo de Satoshi.

### 3. The 7 Pillars of Povo de Satoshi

1. **Absolute Private Property:** True ownership without government interference.
2. **Self-Represented Democracy:** Direct democracy where each member has a voice.
3. **Tax Abolition:** No taxes of any kind, promoting economic freedom.
4. **Free Market:** Encouragement of free trade and economic interactions.
5. **Individual Freedom:** Respect for personal liberties and non-interference in personal choices.
6. **Non-Aggression Ethics:** Coexistence based on mutual respect and voluntary cooperation.
7. **Private Laws and Justice:** Laws proposed and voted on by members, ensuring a society governed by collective values.

### 4. Bitcoin Tokenizer

The Tokenizer will develop and market tokens necessary for the establishment and functioning of Povo de Satoshi. These tokens will facilitate ownership, participation, and the funding of the project.

### 5. Team and Implementation

The project will be carried out by a dedicated team committed to the principles of decentralization and transparency. Funds raised from token sales will be used for land acquisition, infrastructure development, and other necessary expenses.

### 6. Final Considerations

We invite all who share our vision to join us in building the first decentralized nation. This document represents the initial blueprint, and it will be updated as the project evolves. Together, we can make this dream a reality and redefine social organization for the future.

**Abstract:** Following the successful establishment of "Povo de Satoshi" as a decentralized nation, "Terra de Satoshi" will be launched as an example project. This document outlines the vision and structure of Terra de Satoshi, which will serve as a model for other experimental projects and create a free market of state services.

### 1. Introduction

Terra de Satoshi aims to be a concrete realization of the philosophical theories underpinning Povo de Satoshi. It will demonstrate the principles of a sustainable and collaborative society, with decentralized governance based on tokens issued on the Bitcoin network.

### 2. Vision for Terra de Satoshi

Terra de Satoshi will embody the principles of economic freedom, private property, and individual liberty. It will serve as an exemplary project, providing a platform for members of Povo de Satoshi to experiment with various models of governance and community organization.

### 3. Private and Decentralized Nation

- **Private Ownership:** Members of Povo de Satoshi will own fractions of Terra de Satoshi through tokens, introducing financial democracy and ensuring that each individual has a stake in the nation's success.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Terra de Satoshi will operate without a central government, with decisions made collectively by its members. The nation will be established on multiple continents, ensuring a truly decentralized presence.

### 4. Implementation and Development

The implementation of Terra de Satoshi will follow a phased approach:

1. **Initial Community:** The first community will be established with 210,000 "Satoshi Citizens."
2. **Global Expansion:** Acquire land on all continents to create multiple decentralized communities, forming a global network of Terra de Satoshi units.

### 5. The Role of Bitcoin Tokenizer

The Tokenizer will continue to develop and market tokens for Terra de Satoshi, ensuring a seamless connection between ownership, participation, and the funding of the project.

### 6. Final Considerations

Terra de Satoshi represents the next step in realizing the vision of a decentralized, private, and free society. By launching this project after the establishment of Povo de Satoshi, we aim to create a model for other experimental communities and foster a free market of state services. We invite everyone to join us in this groundbreaking initiative.
